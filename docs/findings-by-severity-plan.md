# Findings by severity — PR list + Agent runs timeline

**Status:** done — implemented on `feat/findings-by-severity`, all 22 steps
landed, verified via automated tests + a manual browser pass (with the
`tableCard.overflow: hidden` clipping fix from step 22's manual pass, not
in the original plan).

**2026-08-05 correction:** the plan's own decision — "PR-list badge = the
PR's **latest review** only (not summed across agents)" — turned out wrong
in practice. When "Run all agents" runs N agents in one click, each agent
gets its own `reviews` row with its own `createdAt`; picking literally the
single most-recent row means whichever agent happened to finish last
determines the badge, silently hiding every other agent's findings from
the SAME action if that last agent found nothing. Same bug, same root
cause, on `latest_run_cost_usd` (from `docs/review-cost-plan.md`'s later
addendum, commit `122c07c`) — "the cost of the last run" also picked one
`agent_runs` row instead of summing every agent from the last batch. Fixed
by reviving the previously-unused `multi_agent_runs` table: one row per
`POST /pulls/:id/review` call, every `agent_runs` row it creates stamped
with `multi_agent_run_id`; the PR list now sums findings/cost across every
run sharing the PR's latest batch id (SCORE stays tied to the single most
recent review — not meaningfully summable). See
`server/src/modules/pulls/routes.ts` and the regression test in
`server/test/reviews.it.test.ts` ("PR-list FINDINGS/COST sum every agent
from the LAST 'run all' action…").

## Context

Neither screen shows a severity breakdown today: `PRRow.tsx` has no
FINDINGS column at all, and `RunHistory.tsx`'s timeline shows a plain-text
total ("3 findings"). Mockups show compact per-severity badges
(🔴/🟡/🔵 + number) on both, opening a click-popover with the actual
findings (title, category, file:line, confidence%, rationale snippet).

Decisions already made: PR-list badge = the PR's **latest review** only
(not summed across agents — avoids double-counting the same finding flagged
by two agents). Counts are **live** (reflect current `dismissed_at`, not a
snapshot — an accepted finding still counts, only a dismissed one drops
out). Popover = click, reusing the existing `Dropdown` component (no hover,
no new floating-ui primitive). Both layers ship together.

Because counts must be live, they can't be a cheap static column
(unlike `cost_usd`/`score`/`blockers`) — they need a read-time query. That
makes Screen A (PR list) need real backend work, while Screen B (Agent runs
timeline) needs **none** — `GET /pulls/:id/reviews` already returns every
review's full findings (with `dismissed_at`) plus `run_id`, and the PR
detail page already fetches it; it just isn't threaded down to
`RunHistory` yet.

`server/src/modules/pulls/status.ts` already has `rollupSeverities()` /
`SeverityCounts` — written, unit-tested, unused. Reuse it, don't rewrite it.

## Plan

1. `server/src/vendor/shared/contracts/platform.ts` **and**
   `client/src/vendor/shared/contracts/platform.ts` — add to `PrMeta`:
   `latest_review_id: z.string().nullish()` and
   `findings: z.object({ critical: z.number().int(), warning: z.number().int(), suggestion: z.number().int() }).nullish()`.
2. `server/src/modules/pulls/routes.ts` — extend the existing
   `latestReviewByPr` map to also select `t.reviews.id`.
3. Same file — new query mirroring the existing `costByPr` block: select
   `{ reviewId, severity }` from `findings` where
   `reviewId IN (latestReviewIds) AND dismissedAt IS NULL`, group in JS by
   `reviewId` (fixed 2-query pattern, not N-query).
4. Same file — feed each group through `rollupSeverities()` (import from
   `./status.js`, already imports `deriveReviewStatus` from there) instead
   of writing new grouping logic.
5. Same file — add `latest_review_id` and `findings` to the row-mapping
   return; delete the stale "intentionally not surfaced" comment. No DB
   migration — pure read-time aggregation.
6. `client/src/vendor/ui/kit/Dropdown.tsx` — make `items` optional, add
   `children?: React.ReactNode` and `onOpenChange?: (open: boolean) => void`;
   backward compatible with all 6 existing callers.
7. New `client/src/vendor/ui/primitives/SeverityCounts.tsx` — stateless row
   of `SeverityBadge` (already supports `compact`+`count`) for nonzero
   severities only; export from `primitives/index.ts`.
8. New `client/src/components/findings-popover/helpers.ts` —
   `liveFindings()` (drops `dismissed_at`-set findings) and
   `sortForPopover()` (severity order, then confidence desc).
9. New `client/src/components/findings-popover/FindingsPopoverList.tsx` —
   popover body styled like `FindingCard`'s collapsed header
   (`SeverityBadge`, `CategoryTag`, `MonoLink`+`githubBlobUrl`,
   `ConfidenceNum`), plain-text truncated rationale (~140 chars, not
   `<Markdown>` — truncating markdown mid-token renders broken syntax),
   scrollable body (`maxHeight`/`overflow: auto`, no hard cap on count).
10. `client/src/lib/hooks/reviews.ts` — add `enabled` param:
    `usePrReviews(prId, enabled = true)`, backward compatible.
11. Same file — fix `useFindingAction`'s `onSuccess` to also
    `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["pulls"] })`. Real bug fix: today
    dismissing a finding never invalidates the list's cache key at all.
12. `client/src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/constants.ts` — add `"findings"`
    to `COLUMN_KEYS` (between `"score"` and `"status"`) + a matching `GRID`
    track.
13. `client/src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/styles.ts` — add a `findingsCell`
    style.
14. `PRRow.tsx` — new cell: `pr.findings == null` → "—"; all-zero → green
    "No findings"; otherwise a `Dropdown` (trigger = `SeverityCounts`,
    `onOpenChange` drives a lazy `usePrReviews(pr.id, open)` filtered to
    `latest_review_id`, content = `FindingsPopoverList`). Wrap the whole
    cell in `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` from the **outside** of
    `<Dropdown>` — the row itself navigates on click and `Dropdown`'s
    trigger doesn't stop propagation on its own (same pattern already used
    by `ReviewRunAccordion`'s delete button).
15. `FindingsTab.tsx` — pass `reviews={runs}` to its existing `RunHistory`
    call (the data's already fetched on this page, just not threaded down).
16. `RunHistory.tsx` — accept `reviews?: ReviewRecord[]`, match each run by
    `run_id`, replace the plain-text findings line with
    `SeverityCounts`+`Dropdown` (no lazy fetch needed, no `stopPropagation`
    needed — this list has no row-level click to guard against).
17. `client/messages/en/prReview.json` — add `list.columns.findings`,
    `list.findingsNone`, and a `findingsPopover.{header,empty,loading}`
    block.
18. `server/test/reviews.it.test.ts` — extend the existing map-reduce test
    to assert `latest_review_id`/`findings` on the list response; add an
    assertion that dismissing a finding then re-fetching the list drops the
    count (the one test proving "live," not snapshot, behavior).
19. `PRRow.test.tsx` — extend the `pr()` factory + add reviewed/zero/null
    cases (mock `@/lib/hooks/reviews` for the lazy fetch).
20. `RunHistory.test.tsx` — extend `renderRuns` with an optional `reviews`
    param; assert badges render for a matched run and the plain-text
    fallback for an unmatched one.
21. New `FindingsPopoverList.test.tsx` (happy path + empty) and
    `Dropdown.test.tsx` (first direct test of this shared component —
    cover both the new `children`/`onOpenChange` path and the existing
    `items` path, since 6+ other consumers depend on it staying correct).
22. Verify: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` in `server/` and `client/`, then
    a manual pass — badges render and match the mockups; clicking one opens
    a popover with the right findings; dismissing a finding and returning
    to the list shows the dropped count without a manual refresh; the
    timeline's per-run badges reflect that run's own findings, not the PR's
    latest-review findings, when a non-latest run is shown.
